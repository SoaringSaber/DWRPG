# Dandy's World - The Text-Based RPG
## Original Game by Quelver - RPG by SoaringSaber
"A nice RPG where all you need to do is *hug everyone like pals, though* it's *harder* than *expected, man*!"
## Disclaimer:
Just like some AUs, and some depictions in the original...
The final game will deal with heavy topics like death, grief, some descriptions of gore, and potentially other disturbing content to some. If you feel uncomfortable with the above, please don't play. If by popular demand people want to censor that text, it might be implemented. If you're completely fine with the content, please enjoy the game, and THANKS FOR PLAYING!
## How To Play the Demo:
Note: This is a canary build, so some things will absolutely break.

*Another* Note: There's not much functionality outside of making dialouge. Unless you code most of the game yourself.

- Download Python, all of the game files (excluding the mapmaker), and open command prompt in the containing folder.
- Using "pip", install the required library "pynput" using: "pip install pynput"

Afterwards, launch "a.py" and get to testing out some dialouge, I suppose.
