Hello!

Before you play, please do the following...

## For Windows
* Install PYTHON 3.13 through the Microsoft Store.
* Open the Command Prompt to the folder that holds game files.
* Download the required library "pynput" by typing:
  "pip install pynput"
## For Linux
* Install PYTHON 3.13.
* Open the terminal to the folder that holds game files.
* Download "pynput" through pip.
Afterwards, you're all set!

## Note:
Please launch the game from "a.py", as it is the launcher.

You can do this by launching through python itself, or by typing:
"python a.py" in the folder containing the game.



THANK YOU FOR TRYING THIS HORRIBLE THING OUT
