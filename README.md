Hello!

Before you play, please do the following...



* Install PYTHON 3.13 through the Microsoft Store.
* Open the Command Prompt to this folder, either by using the context menu and clicking "Open in Command Prompt" or cd'ing to it.
* Download the required library "pynput" by typing:
  "pip install pynput"
* Afterwards, you're all set!



Please launch the game from "a.py", as it is the launcher.

You can do this by launching through python itself, or by typing:
"python a.py" in the folder containing the game.



THANK YOU FOR TRYING THIS HORRIBLE THING OUT
