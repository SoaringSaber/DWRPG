"A nice RPG where all you need to do is *hug everyone like pals, though* it's *harder* than *expected, man*!"



##### Disclaimer:

Just like some AUs, and some depictions in the original...

This game deals with heavy topics like death, grief, some descriptions of gore, and potentially other disturbing content

to some. If you feel uncomfortable with the above, please don't play. If by popular demand people want to censor that text,

it might be implemented. If you're completely fine with the content, please enjoy the game, and THANKS FOR PLAYING!



##### Changelog:





Launch the game from a.py, that's the launcher.

Launching anywhere else won't get you anything.
